    <h1>WITH DUE RESPECT TO REFERENCE YOU</h1>
    <h2>I first of all say the warmest and biggest thank you to The Most High God Almighty who
       have made me a manifestation and testimony.</h2><br>
       <h3>I then send gratitudes to every single soul for any form of encounter to have been a factor 
    to have me reaching this far.</h3></h2>
    <p> I mention to you the names of great people and the impacts they 
have made in my life.<br>
<br>Sir Mark Rockson Senior, a man of courage, principles, vision, passion and not the least brains 
to keep dead engines running. A man who made it coming from nothing, one who planted the seed 
of gift. I can't express my gratitude with words but I believe The Most High will continue to 
be with you through all your life. <br><br>
Madam Lillian Evon Neil, the womb that formed and kept me through the whole period of great 
manufacturing and then finally delivering the great gift to the world. I always thank God for my 
mum because she has been the most amazing woman I have ever known.</p>
<p>Mr. Emmanuel Ebo Budu-Mensah, the CEO, Perfect Care Ventures.Specialist in all fire related matters, 
     installation and supplies of all fire equipment. This man is a one of a kind in all forms of 
     generousity. He has been a strong back bone to the nurturing of the gift to the world.
