   <p>Bloodline DieHARD was set in motion in the year 2019 by Rocky_Jr. The family 
    had to come together to achieve all goals and ambitions therefore do not have to
give up at any moment and so the slogan amplified as Champion DieHARD became a compound 
name for all those who knew me personally and also some other distant relatives.<br>
<br>Rockson Mark Junior is the formal name of Rocky_Jr, born in the 90's I attended SARCOMS 
to attain nursery eduacation after which I was enrolled at Mother Maria Theresea Haze 
Int. Sch. for Kindergaten, primary and junior high school eduacation. I furthered to 
Sedass to continue with the secondary level certification which lasted four years ending 
in May 2013. 
Life became more demanding and wishes are never bed of roses and so I decided to fetch some 
technical skills and joined in with Guardian View Technology. It was a very great experience 
with the whole team there, the CEO, Mr. Prince Obeng-Buampong and my master Mr. Stephen Salam 
has been very good. I had field and theological eduacation and experience in Electric fencing, 
CCTV, gate automation and other practical fields.<br>
<br>After leaving <abbr title="Guardian View Technology">GVT</abbr> I took a program at IPMC where 
I studied some bit of IT then after getting more intense with the music career, I started some 
recording sessions that got me some experiences and songs leading to gaining some fans to my
tunes as I got on board with "21XO", that's a family of my family because I'm a family and I 
love the family as it is a twin of Champion DieHARD Bloodline. I relate to people like 
Juju Montana King, Mr. Keita, B-Money, Dani-X. I currently have about 40 songs with 
21XO which is still counting. We happened to work with several engineers like Fidi, Dave Ghana 
and others but our most regular engineer was and is Jake D'Prince who is another incredible genius.<br><br>
I then met Blakk some day at his shop and as the negotiations and  conversation went we happened to 
click by nature and that's how we began to work on our passion together since we had common 
aspirations and as well story. K_Blakk made the beats and then I made the songs so we made some 
good songs of which we can count about 10 songs at the moment with lots without count still 
cooking.<br><br>
I currently enrol at the Takoradi Technical University taking a program in IT. I am an IT 
student and music is my passion so I love to write most often, create relateable music for my 
listeners to ease up the stress and keep the fire burning till the end. I am working on getting my 
songs to the whole world, to every soul that needs a cheer, to all who think all is lost and so 
continue to fight. Let's share the Joy.<br> "Life will always be tough so you have to be tougher".
